# DLK

**DLK**, acronym for Didactical Language for Kids, is an imperative programming language that I developed for my bachelor's final thesis. DLK's syntax is clear and easy and all DLK's keywords are in Italian in order to be a good **entry level** programming language.

## About this repository
In this repository you can find: my thesis, the DLK interpreter and some easy example written in DLK.

## The interpreter
In order to use the interpreter, you have to run **DLK.py** and then follow the textual instructions.  
The DLK interpreter works only with textual file (.txt or .dlk extensions).

## Requirements
* [Python 3.8 or latest](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
